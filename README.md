# Shoplifting-detection-Model-Using-CNN
 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for image classification, distinguishing between shoplifting and non-shoplifting scenarios. Integrated the model into a user-friendly interface with Gradio for real-time predictions and implemented an alert system for potential shoplifting incidents
