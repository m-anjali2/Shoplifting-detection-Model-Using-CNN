# Shoplifting-detection-Model-Using-CNN
 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for image classification, distinguishing between shoplifting and non-shoplifting scenarios. Integrated the model into a user-friendly interface with Gradio for real-time predictions and implemented an alert system for potential shoplifting incidents

# Shoplifting Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect shoplifting behavior in images. The model is trained on a dataset of images labeled as shoplifting and not-shoplifting. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning tasks.

## Features
- Utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for feature extraction.
- Implements data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset.
- Provides a user interface for uploading images and predicting whether they contain shoplifting behavior.
- Includes an alert system for notifying users in case of a shoplifting prediction.
